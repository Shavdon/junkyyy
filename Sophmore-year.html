        <p>Those are the classes I can remember that I take last year.


        Chemistry was one of my favorite class because I get to know the
        periodic table of elements.</p>

          <p>My sophmore year I was in chemistry class where we learn the different chemicals
             and the reaction example 2H‚ÇÇ + O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2H‚ÇÇO (water), NaCl + AgNO‚ÇÉ ‚Üí AgCl + NaNO‚ÇÉ
              (sodium chloride and silver nitrate react to form silver chloride and sodium nitrate),
              CH‚ÇÑ + 2O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CO‚ÇÇ + 2H‚ÇÇO (methane burning)In addition to these main types, other reactions like 
              acid-base reactions (neutralization) and redox reactions can also be classified 
              as types of chemical reactions. We also learn the different chemical bonds .
              <ul>
                <li> Ionic Bonds:
                    Ionic bonds form between oppositely charged ions due to electrostatic attraction. 
                    One atom donates an electron to another, creating positive and negative ions that attract. 
                    Examples include sodium chloride (NaCl). </li>

                    <li> Covalent Bonds:
                        Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms, typically nonmetal atoms. 
                        They can be single, double, or triple bonds, depending on the number of shared electron pairs. 
                        Examples include water (H‚ÇÇO) and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ). </li>

                        <li> Metallic Bonds:
                            Metallic bonds occur between metal atoms, where positive metal ions are surrounded by a sea of delocalized valence electrons. 
                            These electrons allow metals to conduct electricity and heat. 
                            Examples include copper (Cu) and other metals. </li>

                            <li> Hydrogen Bonds:
                                Hydrogen bonds are a weaker type of bond between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) and another highly electronegative atom. 
                                They play a crucial role in the properties of water and biological molecules. 
                                Examples include the attraction between water molecules. </li>
              </ul>
