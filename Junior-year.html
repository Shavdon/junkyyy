        <h2>Junior year</h2>

        <p>Junior year is one of the best year because I am 
            familiar with everyone and the work is kinda easy, this is also the 
            my first year taking programming class. When I first got here I thought this 
            was a boring class but once I get the work and notice that it was about 
            what i wanted to do after I finshed highschool I started taking the class
            serious. When it gets in the middle of the year and the coding started getting
            hard I kinda wanted to change my mind but I still have that mindset to 
            be a programming engineer when I finish high school.
            I can't wait to be a senior and finish high school to persue my dream 
            and see what I really want to do.
